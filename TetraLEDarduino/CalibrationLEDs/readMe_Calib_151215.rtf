\f0\fs24 \cf0 LED calibration 15/12/15\
by LEW\
\
Fibre optic cable aligned approx. 4cm away from the aperture and fixed to the chin rest bar, to ensure exact positioning between measurements of each LED.\
\
2 second integration\
3 scans to average\
\
Dark spectrum stored using above setting (end of cable covered, room lights/monitors/etc off), and then \'91Scope minus dark\'92 used for taking the calibration measurements.\
\
Each LED turned on one at a time, using the LED_calibration arduino script (change currentLEDon value between 0 and 4 depending on which LED you want on).\
\
All lights in room off, all monitors off and red light on the Jaz covered, before the measurement was taken and then saved in .txt and .ProcSpec formats.\
\
The spectra were combined into a single .mat file using the ProcessCalibFiles.m script (which uses the .txt files)}
