function LEDStim = tetra_led_makeStimArduino(dpy,stimLMS)
% stim=makeStim(dpy,expt)
% Create the stimulus by inputting the following variables:
%
% dpy is the display structure. It should contain the spectra of each of
% the LEDs in steps of 2nm between 400 and 700nm
% dpy.spectra
% It can also contain a comment field dpy.comment and/or a peaks field
% dpy.peaks
% If only dpy.peaks is present this function will assume that the matrix
% dpy.peaks is a 2xn containing peak, FWHM for each of n LEDs.
% dpy must also contain channel numbers for each spectrum / peak.
%
% expt is a big structure containing
% expt.stim.temporal     freq
%                   duration
% expt.stim.chrom        stimLMS.dir
%                   stim.scale

%% Here we set up the cone fundamentals.
% First we check to see if cone spectra are defined in the dpy structure.
% If they are, we use them by default..
% Note: Here we take out the generation of the sine waves - this is done on
% the arduino now - our job here is to generate LED values.
% For each LED, we will send to the ardunio four sets of numbers: amplitude,
% frequency, duration and phase.
