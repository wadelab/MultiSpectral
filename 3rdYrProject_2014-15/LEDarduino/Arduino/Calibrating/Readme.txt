This script allows you to set a particular LED to ‘on’ while the rest are ‘off’, so that the LED can be calibrated.

Currently, as this is not linked to the SpectraSuite software, it is a manual script that requires changing which LED is set to ‘ledstate2’ (on), with the rest set to ‘ledstate1’ (off).

TODO – make this a loop that is self-paced.  This way the calibration can be done in SpectraSuite, and then a key pressed to indicate that the next LED should be switched on.  Need to make sure this an obscure key (e.g. # or * (from numpad)), because running and saving out the calibrations in SpectraSuite will require use of the keyboard and mouse
