% overview of led flicker code


1: initialization code. Stores the results in a structure called 'session'
2: Also initialize the 'display' stucture dpy containing info on the LEDs (esp the specta)

3: Then call a routine 'led_getScanStruct'returning a structure 'scan' that contains fields

scan.trials
scan.comment

scan.trials is an array of n trials

scan.trials(n).stimulus
scan.trials(n).onsetTime



4: Wait for the scan to begin. This can be triggered by a TTL pulse into the DIO cards or else a keypress translated by thr forp.

5: Enter a function pry_doScan(session,dpy,scan)
Note the time when this fn is called using either 'now' or 'getsecs'

Enter a big loop   for thisTrial=1:nTrials
4.1: build the trial described in scan.trial(thisTrial) - returns the data in a big array ready for sending in yo the daq
4.2 load the data into the daq 
4.3 wait until the elapsed scan time > scan.trials(thisTrial).onsetTime
4.4 trigger the daq in foreground mode
4.5 next stimulus


5: Exit the doScan function once all the trials are over
SAVE!
6: Shut down the daq and release the session

That's it!


functions 

led_doScan

led_getScanStruct

led_makeTrials

led_shutdown

We will require the psych toolbox as well - for the quest routines and the getsecs
